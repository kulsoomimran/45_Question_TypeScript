/* TASK # 45 :
Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
 The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
 It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
 Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
 Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. */
